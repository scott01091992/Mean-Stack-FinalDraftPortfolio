The difference between good design and bad design is more than just the way a website looks and feels. There is the useability of the site, the user experience of the site, the confidence in the brand or information and the influence that design has on the users actions within the site.</p><div id="designexampleone" class="designexample"><img src="./../assets/logoexampleone.png"/><h2>Logos</h2></div><div id="designexampletwo" class="designexample"><img src="./../assets/stylescapeexampleone.png"/><h2>Stylescapes</h2></div><div id="designexamplethree" class="designexample"><img src="./../assets/typographyexampleone.png"/><h2>Typography</h2></div></div></div><div id="development"><div class="transition"><h2>"Building websites is a whole lot of fun to me.

I had to build out a relational database and the functions to interact with it. That is what took up most of the time. The rest of my time was spent on validation, design and testing out updating content on the live server. <a href="http://brandonsdevblog.com/">Visit Site</a></p></div><ul><li>MEAN</li><li>Responsive Design</li><li>Login & Registration</li><li>SMTP Email Form</li><li>Validation</li><li>Git & Ubuntu Server</li></ul></div><div class="devexamples"><img src="../assets/portfolioss.PNG"/><div><h3>Portfolio | October 2016</h3><p>This was my second attempt at building a portfolio. I had just recently discovered design concepts and wanted to try to use them here. I started with simple ideas such as typography and color choices. I searched for a good stock image for the background and I spent a lot of time working on animations. I got to experiment with parallax and JS scroll detection to load in animations as the page was scrolled through. This was also my first experience working with SMTP and creating emails in JavaScript. The most difficult part of building this application was holding off on loading the YouTube videos till the user interacted with them. This was because otherwise they would all load at the start and it would slow down the load times significantly. <a href="http://brandonscottdev.com/">Visit Site</a></p></div><ul><li>MEAN</li><li>Fast Load YouTube </li><li>JS Scrolling</li><li>SMTP Email Form</li><li>Parallax</li></ul></div><div class="devexamples"><img src="../assets/discussionboardss.PNG"/><div><h3>MEAN Project | August 2016</h3><p>This was a final project that I created for my Bootcamp class. We needed to create a discussion board application using Angular and MongoDB. Deep populating my queries was the lesson that took the most research to get it working correctly. After taking on Angular, switching from the LAMP stack, I really enjoyed the way Angular worked and was excited to make JavaScript my new coding language.</p></div><ul><li>MEAN</li><li>Login & Registration</li><li>Validation</li><li>Relational Database</li><li>Bootstrap</li></ul></div></div></div><div id="skills"><div class="transition"><h2>"I've got a bunch of skills to work with, but I am always <br>trying to add to my skill toolkit"</h2></div><div class="skillsexamples"><div class="skill"><img src="../assets/coding.svg"/><div class="skilldata"><h3>Front-End Development</h3><div id="barfrontend"></div><h4>HTML5 | Jade | CSS3 | SASS/SCSS | Flexbox | Bootstrap | CSS Animation | JavaScript | JQuery | Angular | React</h4></div></div><div class="skill"><img src="../assets/js.svg"/><div class="skilldata"><h3>Back-End Development</h3><div id="barbackend"></div><h4>Node | Express | MongoDB | MySQL | PHP | Mongoose | Sockets | Bcrypt | CodeIgniter | CMS</h4></div></div><div class="skill"><img src="../assets/fountain-pen-1.svg"/><div class="skilldata"><h3>Design</h3><div id="bardesign"></div><h4>Typography | Color Theory | UX | Logo Design | Photography | Design Concepts | Wireframes | Mockups</h4></div></div><div class="skill"><img src="../assets/computer-3.svg"/><div class="skilldata"><h3>Strategy</h3><div id="barstrategy"></div><h4>Brand Strategy | Research | SEO | Social Media | Content Strategy | Empathy Maps </h4></div></div><div class="skill"><img src="../assets/worldwide.svg"/><div class="skilldata"><h3>Communication</h3><div id="barcommunication"></div><h4>Customer Service | Management | Collaboration | Training | Problem Solving | Networking | Engagement</h4></div></div></div></div><div id="closing"><div class="transition"><h2>"I'm on a mission to become stronger every day.
